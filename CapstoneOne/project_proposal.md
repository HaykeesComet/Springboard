## Capstone Project Proposal: *Drink Up!* - Cocktail Search Application

## Introduction

The Cocktail Search Application, which will be called '**Drink Up!**', is a web-based platform designed to allow users to search for cocktails using an external Cocktails API. Users can input the name of a cocktail they are interested in, and the application will display a list of matching cocktails along with their names and images. Additionally, users can click on a cocktail to view more detailed information about it.

## Features

* **Search Functionality**: Users can enter the name of a cocktail in the search form.
* **Display Results**: Display a list of cocktails matching the search query, including their names and images.
* **Detailed View**: Clicking on a cocktail will navigate to a separate page displaying more information about the selected cocktail.
* **Error Handling**: If no cocktails match the search query, display a message such as "Sorry, no drinks matched!".

## Technologies

* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **API**: Cocktails API (e.g., TheCocktailDB API)

## Components

* **Search Form**: Allows users to input the name of a cocktail.
* **Results Display**: Displays a list of cocktails matching the search query, each with a name and image.
* **Detailed View Page**: Shows more information about a selected cocktail, such as ingredients, instructions, and an image.

## Implementation Steps

* **Set Up Project**: Create the necessary files and folders for the project structure.
* **Design UI**: Develop the user interface with HTML and CSS, including the search form, results display, and detailed view page.
* **Fetch API Data**: Use JavaScript to fetch data from the Cocktails API based on the user's search query.
* **Display Results**: Render the retrieved data on the results page, showing cocktail names and images.
* **Handle Click Events**: Implement functionality to handle clicks on cocktail items and navigate to the detailed view page.

## Conclusion
