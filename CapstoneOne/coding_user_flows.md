# Coding User Flows

## Overview

Here is an example implementation of the user flows with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for a capstone project utilizing CRUD operations for cocktail API endpoints:

**Set Up Project Structure:**

* Create necessary folders and files (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js).
* Initialize a Git repository for version control.

**Design User Interface (UI):**

* Create a search form in index.html with an input field for cocktail name search.
* Design the results display section to show cocktail names and images, which users can click on a cocktail to view more detailed information about it.
* Include forms or modals for adding, editing, and deleting cocktails.

**Fetch API Data:**

* In script.js, fetch data from the Cocktail API using fetch() or XMLHttpRequest.
* Handle API responses and errors appropriately.

**Display Results:**

Render the fetched data on the results display section in index.html.

**Handle Click Events:**

* Implement event listeners for search, add, edit, and delete operations.

**CRUD Operations:**

* Implement functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting cocktails using the Cocktail API endpoints.
