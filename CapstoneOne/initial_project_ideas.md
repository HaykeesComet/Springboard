# Project Ideas

Hector Sevilla - Capstone Project Ideas:

## Cocktails API

User is going to be able to search for cocktails by typing the names in the search form. And if the search yields results, it’s going to display a list of cocktails, each with a name as well as an image. Each cocktail item will have the ability to navigate onto a separate page, where more information about the cocktail will be displayed. If the search does not yield any results, it will say something like, “Sorry, no drinks matched!”.

## Furniture E-commerce Store

Shoppers will be able to filter products by clicking one of the listed furniture companies within a side navigation area and/or manually typing text input in the search form and/or adjusting the price slider. The shopping site will be responsive for a great customer user experience on all devices.

## Online Book Catalog

This will be a web application that displays a list of books stored in a database. Users will be able to register an account, securely log in and out of the application, as well as perform operations like creating, updating and deleting records during their login sessions.
