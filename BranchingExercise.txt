Branching Exercise

Part I

Answer the following questions:

- What git command creates a branch?
    git branch <name of branch> or git checkout -b <name of branch>
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
    Fast-forward merge is merging automatically, where changes in second branch are added to the unchanged original branch. 
    While recursive merge happens when new commit changes are done in original branch after creating the second branch that also has commits.
- What git command changes to another branch?
    git checkout <name of branch>
- What git command deletes a branch?
    git branch -d <name of branch>
- How do merge conflicts happen?
    When a commitment of the same file is performed in both original branch and its' second branch. Then trying to merge both branches.

Part II

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
